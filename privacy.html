        <h1>Command Legacy — Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: January 29, 2026</em></p>

        <p><strong>Command Legacy is built on a foundation of trust. We do not sell your data to third parties. We do not share your information with your department unless the department is paying for your account. We collect only what's necessary to provide you with accurate law reference and community features.</strong></p>

        <p>Harbor Security Technologies, LLC ("Company", "we", "our", or "us"), operating as Command Legacy, respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes how we collect, process, retain, and disclose personal data about you when providing services to you through our mobile application that links to this policy and the services we provide via the mobile application ("Services") and our practices for using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>We may provide additional or different privacy policies that are specific to certain features, services, or activities.</p>

        <p>Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we treat it. By interacting with our Services or providing us with your information, you agree to the collection, use, and sharing of your information as described in this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy). Your continued use of the Services after we make changes as described here is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.</p>

        <p>Our Services are not intended for, and we do not knowingly collect any personal data from, children under the age of 18. If we learn we have collected or received personal data from a child under 18 years old without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.</p>

        </ul>

        <p>If we combine or connect non-personal statistical or technical data with personal data so that it directly or indirectly identifies an individual, we treat the combined information as personal information.</p>

        <h2>How We Collect Your Personal and Other Data</h2>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices About Your Information</h2>
        <p>This section describes mechanisms you can use to control certain uses and disclosures of your information and rights you may have under state law, depending on where you live.</p>

        <h3>Advertising, marketing, cookies, and other tracking technologies choices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies.</strong> You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies or other tracking technology files, or to alert you when these files are being sent. You can choose whether or not to allow the Services to collect information through other tracking technologies by adjusting your device settings. If you disable or refuse cookies or similar tracking files, some Services features may be inaccessible or not function properly. Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) setting that can send a signal to the online services you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services may not respond to all browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described in this policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotions by the Company.</strong> If you do not wish us to use your information to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt out by logging into your account and adjusting your account settings and preferences or sending us an email stating your request to Privacy@commandlegacy.io.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted Advertising by the Company.</strong> If you do not want us to use information that we collect or that you provide to us to deliver advertisements according to our advertisers' target audience preferences, you can opt out by emailing Privacy@commandlegacy.io. For this opt out to function, you must have your browser set to accept all browser cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising.</strong> If you do not want us to share your personal data with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties for advertising and marketing purposes, you can opt out by emailing Privacy@commandlegacy.io. You can also opt out by logging into your account and adjusting your account settings and preferences or sending us an email stating your request to Privacy@commandlegacy.io. We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. To learn more about opting out of receiving targeted ads from members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), including how to add the NAI Global Privacy Control (GPC) extension to your Chrome web browser, see NAI: How to Opt Out.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Location data choices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data.</strong> You can choose whether or not to allow the Services to collect and use real-time information about your device's location through the device's privacy settings. If you block the use of location information, some Services features may become inaccessible or not function properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Your State Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>Depending on your state of residency, you may have certain rights related to your personal data, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Data Portability.</strong> You may confirm whether we process your personal data and access a copy of the personal data we process. To the extent feasible and required by state law, depending on your state, data will be provided in a portable format. Depending on your state, you may have the right to receive additional information and it will be included in the response to your access request.</li>
            <li><strong>Correction.</strong> You may request that we correct inaccuracies in your personal data that we maintain, taking into account the information's nature and processing purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion.</strong> You may request that we delete personal data about you that we maintain, subject to certain exception under applicable law.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt Out of Using Personal Data for Targeted Advertising, Profiling, and Sales.</strong> You may request that we do not use your personal data for these purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Important:</strong> The exact scope of these rights vary by state. There are also several exceptions where we may not have an obligation to fulfill your request.</p>

        <p>To exercise any of these rights, please email Privacy@commandlegacy.io. To appeal a decision regarding a consumer rights request, please reply to the email response you received regarding your original request.</p>

        <p>Some browsers and browser extensions support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC") that can send a signal to process your request to opt out from certain types of data processing, including data "sales" as defined under certain laws. When we detect such a signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your choices indicated by a GPC setting as required by applicable law.</p>

        <p>Nevada provides its residents with a limited right to opt out of certain personal data sales. Residents who wish to exercise their sale opt-out rights may submit a request to Privacy@commandlegacy.io. However, please know we do not currently sell data triggering that statute's opt-out requirements.</p>

        <h2>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We use commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to protect your personal data from accidental loss or destruction and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, no website, mobile application, system, electronic storage, or online service is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to, through, using, or in connection with the Services. In particular, email, texts, and chats sent to or from the Services may not be secure, and you should carefully decide what information you send to us via such communications channels. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk.</p>

        <p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. You are responsible for taking steps to protect your personal data against unauthorized use, disclosure, and access.</p>

        <h2>How We Retain Your Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We keep the categories of personal data described in this policy for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes described or for as otherwise legally permitted or required, such as maintaining the Services, operating our organization, complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and for safety, security, and fraud prevention. This means that we consider our legal and business obligations, potential risks of harm, and nature of the information when deciding how long to retain personal data. At the end of the retention period, personal data will be deleted, destroyed, or deidentified.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time, and we will provide notice of any such changes to the policy as required by law. The date the privacy policy was last updated is identified at the top of the page. We will notify you of changes to this policy by updating the "last updated" date and posting the updated policy on the Services. We may email or otherwise communicate reminders about this policy, but you should check our Services periodically to see the current policy and any changes we have made to it.</p>
