    <li><strong>AI legal assistant</strong> – real-time guidance on state laws and policies to support confident on-scene decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Leadership resources</strong> – curated content and peer discussion to help new corporals, field training officers, and sergeants succeed in their roles.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Access is limited to <em>verified law enforcement personnel only</em>. There are no subscriptions at this time – participation is free once verified.</p>
