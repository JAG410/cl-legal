    <Command Legacy Beta — Terms of Participation

Last updated: Spetember 25, 2025

Welcome. By participating in the Command Legacy beta (“Beta”), you agree to these Terms of Participation (the “Agreement”). If you do not agree, you should decline access and not use the Beta Software.

1. Parties & Scope

Company refers to the entity operating Command Legacy. Tester refers to you, the invited beta participant.
This Agreement governs your use of the pre-release software version of Command Legacy (“Beta Software”) and your participation in the Beta test.

2. Licensed Use

You receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Beta Software only for internal evaluation and testing (noncommercial).

You may not:
• distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise share the Software with third parties
• reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software (except where legally required)
• modify or create derivative works
• use the Beta Software to build a competing product

3. Term & Termination

The Beta period runs from your acceptance until public release of Command Legacy (unless earlier terminated).

The Company may suspend or terminate your access at any time, with or without cause. You may also discontinue your participation.

Upon termination (or upon public release), you must stop using the Beta Software and delete or destroy all copies, as directed.

The following sections will survive termination: Confidentiality, IP Rights, Feedback, Disclaimers & Liability, Dispute Resolution, Miscellaneous.

4. Feedback & Data Rights

You agree to respond to surveys and, if selected, participate in interviews about your experience.

You grant the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, integrate, publish, and commercialize that Feedback in any way.

The Company may automatically collect usage data, logs, metrics, error reports, telemetry, and analytics. You consent to that collection.

The Company may anonymize or aggregate your data, or combine it with data from others.

5. Confidentiality

All non-public information about the Beta Software, its design, features, issues, internal documentation, test results, etc. is Confidential Information.

You must not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, or use it for purposes other than Beta participation.

Exceptions: information that (i) is or becomes public through no fault of yours; (ii) was already known by you legally before disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by you without reference to Confidential Information; or (iv) is required by law (provided you notify the Company and allow a protective order).

Confidentiality obligations survive for [3 or 5] years after termination.

6. Disclaimers & Warranties

The Beta Software is provided “as is” and without warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or that the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted.

You accept all risk associated with use, including potential data loss, system instability, or other harms.

7. Limitation of Liability

In no event will the Company be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages (including lost profits, data loss, business interruption, etc.), even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

The Company’s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed US $[nominal amount, e.g. 100] (or another agreed cap), to the extent allowed by law.

These limitations apply even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.

8. Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in and to the Beta Software, including any updates, improvements, or derivative works, remain with the Company.

Your Feedback becomes the Company’s property (see Section 4).

You retain whatever rights you independently hold, but you grant the Company rights as stated above.

9. Updates, Changes, Support

The Company may issue updates, patches, new features, or changes to the Beta Software at its discretion.

Features, behavior, or APIs may change during the Beta.

The Company has no obligation to maintain or support the Beta beyond commercially reasonable efforts.

10. Data, Privacy, & Security

The Company will collect only the data you supply at sign-up and the operational data (telemetry, logs) described above.

The Company commits to applying industry-standard security measures to protect your data.

The Company’s Privacy Policy (linked here) applies to the processing, retention, sharing, and disposal of your data.

You agree to comply with applicable data protection laws in your usage.

11. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by U.S. law (specify state, e.g. Virginia).

All disputes must be resolved by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Arbitration must be in your individual capacity; class or representative actions are waived.

The arbitrator has exclusive authority to decide any question of arbitrability, enforceability, or validity of this Agreement, including the arbitration clause.

12. Miscellaneous

Severability: If a court deems any provision invalid, the remaining terms remain in force.

Waiver: Failure to enforce a right is not a waiver.

Assignment: You may not assign your rights or obligations. The Company may assign to a successor or affiliate.

Amendments: The Company may update this Agreement. Continued participation after notice constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Major changes may require your affirmative consent.

Notices: Notices may be sent via email or posted in the Beta portal.

Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the full understanding regarding your Beta participation and supersedes prior communications or understandings.>
