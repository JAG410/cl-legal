    <h1>Command Legacy Beta — Terms of Participation</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: September 25, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Parties & Scope</h2>
    <p>Company refers to the entity operating Command Legacy. Tester refers to you, the invited beta participant. 
    This Agreement governs your use of the pre-release software version of Command Legacy (“Beta Software”) and your participation in the Beta test.</p>

    <h2>2. Licensed Use</h2>
    <p>You receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Beta Software only for internal evaluation and testing (noncommercial).</p>
    <p>You may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise share the Software with third parties</li>
      <li>reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or derive source code</li>
      <li>modify or create derivative works</li>
      <li>use the Software to build a competing product</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Term & Termination</h2>
    <p>The Beta period runs from your acceptance until public release of Command Legacy, unless earlier terminated. 
    The Company may suspend or terminate your access at any time, including if you behave disrespectfully to other testers, 
    refuse required interaction, or fail to complete required surveys or interviews. Upon termination, you must stop using the Beta Software and delete all copies.</p>

    <h2>4. Feedback & Data Rights</h2>
    <p>You agree to respond to surveys and, if selected, participate in interviews. You grant the Company a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license 
    to use, modify, integrate, publish, and commercialize that Feedback. The Company may automatically collect usage data, logs, error reports, and telemetry 
    and may anonymize or aggregate your data.</p>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>All non-public information about the Beta Software is confidential. You must not disclose it without permission. 
    Exceptions apply where information is public, independently developed, or legally required (with notice to the Company). 
    Confidentiality obligations survive for three (3) years after termination.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimers & Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Beta Software is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, 
    or that it will operate error-free or uninterrupted. You accept all risk, including possible data loss or system instability.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Company is not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages. 
    The Company’s total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed $100 or the minimum amount allowed by law. 
    These limitations apply even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Company retains all rights in the Beta Software, documentation, updates, and improvements. Feedback becomes the Company’s property. 
    You retain rights in your independent data, but grant the Company rights as outlined above.</p>

    <h2>9. Updates, Changes, Support</h2>
    <p>The Company may issue updates, patches, or new features at its discretion. Features may change at any time. 
    The Company has no obligation to maintain or support the Beta beyond commercially reasonable efforts.</p>

    <h2>10. Data, Privacy, & Security</h2>
    <p>The Company will collect only the data you supply at sign-up and the operational data described above. 
    The Company will apply industry-standard security measures. The Privacy Policy governs processing, retention, and sharing of your data.</p>

    <h2>11. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Agreement is governed by U.S. law, with Virginia as the governing state. All disputes must be resolved by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, 
    except that either party may seek injunctive relief in court. Arbitration must be individual; class actions are waived. 
    The arbitrator has exclusive authority over enforceability and validity of this Agreement, including the arbitration clause.</p>

    <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p><strong>Severability:</strong> If a court deems any provision invalid, the rest remain in force.<br>
    <strong>Waiver:</strong> Failure to enforce a right is not a waiver.<br>
    <strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign rights or obligations; the Company may assign to a successor.<br>
    <strong>Amendments:</strong> The Company may update this Agreement. Continued participation after notice constitutes acceptance. Major changes may require affirmative consent.<br>
    <strong>Notices:</strong> May be sent via email or posted in the Beta portal.</p>

    <p><em>This Agreement constitutes the full understanding regarding your Beta participation and supersedes prior communications or understandings.</em></p>
